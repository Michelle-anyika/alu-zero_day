Software Engineering – Learning Journey 
Introduction

I am currently learning Software Engineering, a field focused on designing, building, testing, and maintaining software systems that solve real-world problems. As a learner, my goal is to understand both how software works and how to build scalable, meaningful applications step by step.

Software engineering is not just about writing code — it’s about problem-solving, logical thinking, collaboration, and continuous learning.

What I’m Learning
 Python (Backend & Logic)

Python is one of my main languages because it is:

Easy to read and beginner-friendly

Powerful for backend development

Widely used in APIs, automation, and data handling

What I focus on:

Variables, loops, functions

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Building backend logic

Connecting Python to databases

 Databases (Data Storage & Management)

Databases are essential for storing and managing application data.

What I’m learning:

SQL basics (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

Tables, rows, and relationships

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Connecting databases to backend applications

Databases help applications remember users, records, and real-world information.

 JavaScript (Interactivity & Logic)

JavaScript brings websites to life.

What I focus on:

Basic syntax and logic

DOM manipulation

Handling user interactions

Fetching data from APIs

Connecting frontend to backend

JavaScript helps me make websites interactive and dynamic.

 Frontend Development (UI/UX)

Frontend is what users see and interact with.

Technologies I use:

HTML – structure

CSS – styling and layout

JavaScript – interactivity

My goals:

Build responsive websites

Create clean and user-friendly interfaces

Turn designs into real web pages

Why Software Engineering?

I’m learning software engineering because I want to:

Build solutions that help people

Create real-world applications

Combine technology with creativity

Empower communities through tech

Learning Approach

Practice through projects

Learn step by step

Break problems into small parts

Use Git & GitHub for version control

Keep improving every day

Conclusion

This repository represents my learning journey in software engineering.
I am still learning, building, failing, and improving — and that’s part of the process.
